        "This notebook contains the required task for the third assignment of the Software for Advanced Machine Learning course. Read the task description and change the required cells. \n",
        "\n",
        "Each section represents a stage along implementing your Image Captioning task, from loading and inspecting the dataset to training the model. The sections are to guide you but you do not have to follow that specific order. \n",
        "\n",
        "Copy this notebook to your drive (File -> Save a copy in Drive), edit it and upload the final ipynb file to [Canvas](https://canvas.elte.hu) or upload the link to the Colab notebook itself. If you have your own machine with Jupyter installed, you can work there as well.\n",

        "- Students are given the same dataset (same train-val-test split), which is already preprocessed.\n",
        "- This notebook contains various functions already written to make the student focus on the model training rather than other intermediate steps. All functions are necessary for the code to run properly, please only change the cells that are indicated in the task description.\n",
        "- BLEU-score on the test set should be at least 0.2. Any results below that make the student entitled to get only a maximum of 2 points out of 5.\n",
        "- The emphasis of this assignment is on achieving good results as it is required in practical applications. Your hyperparameter choices are the most important decisions you make when training a model. \n",
        "- We have noticed that some students copy already ran cells with outputs of other students. In certain cases, we will ask to rerun the cells during the defense\n",
        "- As always, copying others' code will make you fail the homework automatically (and thus the course). Remember that you will have to defend the assignment at the end of the semester.\n",
        "- **Deadline is December 14**\n",
        "- Make sure your code can be run from an empty state (use Runtime -> Run all in the menu after restarting the notebook)\n",
        "- Feel free to add more code cells as needed. But don't put code into external Python files to ease the reviewing.\n",
        "- Please add your name and Neptun ID below for easier identification.\n",

        "Given a subset of the COCO Image Captioning dataset, your task is to define hyperparameters to train an Encoder-Decoder with Attention model such that it achieves at least a BLEU score of 0.2 on the test set. \n",
        "Students need to achieve at least 0.2 to get a 3 or 4 depending if they know how to explain their choices. Any score above 0.25 gets a 5 and any score below 0.2 can get a maximum of 2 points, depending on the defense.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code has all the necessary components so that you just change the values of specific cells and get your results. So please, avoid changing the other cell codes. Only change the cells of section 3 (cell 3.3) and section 4 (cell 4.1)\n",
        "The dataset is already preprocessed, the model is already defined, so you have to focus on the right hyperparameter choices in order to achieve good results.\n",
